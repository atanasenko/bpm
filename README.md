# BPM Engine

A simple implementation of an BPM engine, designed to mimic Activiti's behaviour. Optimized for high performance
(rather than strict following of the BPMN specification).

## Main features
- a lightweight BPM engine, inspired by Activiti BPM engine;
- high-performance on-disk persistence;
- event scheduling (e.g. "timers");
- supports Activiti's XML format (both process and visual elements);
- supports JUEL in flow expressions, task delegates, etc;
- JUnit support (and easy unit testing in general).

## Supported elements:
- boundary event (errors and timers);
- call activity;
- end event;
- event-based gateway;
- exclusive gateway;
- inclusive gateway;
- intermediate catch event;
- parallel gateway;
- sequence flow;
- service task;
- start event;
- subprocess.

## Limitations
- tasks with TimerBoundaryEvents executed in a separate thread inside of an unbounded Executor.
- currently there is an unbound storage for element activation records. It is used internally in the engine and can
cause large memory footprint in processes with huge amount of looping (hundreds of thousands loops).

## Prior work
Based on the original implementation at [ibodrov/bpm](https://github.com/ibodrov/bpm).
